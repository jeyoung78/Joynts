# Inspiration
In the era of information where innovation and creation are at the forefront,everyone should have the opportunity to shape and innovate, yet countless individuals with disabilities find the doorway to programming out of reach. Recongnizing the pressing need for inclusivity, we were inspired to create a tool that could bridge the gap, leading to the birth of Joynts.

# What it does
Joynt is an inclusive solution designed to usher individuals with physical disabilities into the world of programming and software development. Through a specialized glove that measures finger movements, users can translate distinct hand gestures into specific programming commands. These movements are then processed and interpreted by our dedicated application, paving the way for real-time code creation and execution.

# How we built it
Beginning with the vision of making coding more accesible, we embedded accelerometers into a glove. These sensors detect finger movements, translating them into Morse code. Paired with a microcontroller, the signals are processed and sent to our custom Python IDE. The platform translates the Morse code into executable code, making the coding experience fluid and intuitive.

# Challenges we ran into
One of the most formidable challenges we faced during the development of Joynts was the intricate task of synchronizing two distinct code processes. Creating a system where one code continuously collects data from the accelerometers in real-time, while another concurrently renders and updates our application, proved to be difficult to implement. Striking the perfect balance between these two operations was crucial for ensuring a fluid user experience, and it demanded rigorous testing, optimization, and countless iterations.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Beyond the technical achievement of Joynts, what truly fills us with pride is the potential impact on the community. By breaking down barriers in programming, we've opened a world of opportunities for countless individuals, empowering them to innovate, create, and express themselves digitally, irrespective of physical challenges.

# What we learned
The journey of creating Joynts taught us the profound value of inclusive design. We delved deep into the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, recognizing that the technology and innovation can make this world more inclusive.

# What's next for Joynts
We envision further refining the user experience, expanding language compatibility beyond Python, and integrating adaptive AI for more personalized coding experiences and improved signal processing. We're also excited about potential collaborations with organizations and institutions to bring Joynts to as many deserving hands as possible.
